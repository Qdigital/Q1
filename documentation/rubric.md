# Leading Indicators Strategy Rubric
_Updated for clarity ahead of Milestone 9: November 31, 2015_

The Leading Indicators Strategy Rubric is intended to provide clarity and transparency on how OMB Staff review Leading Indicators in six categories: Enterprise Data Inventory, Public Data Listing, Public Engagement, Privacy & Security, Human Capital, and Use & Impact. 

This Rubric may be updated as new Leading Indicators are informed by [Project Open Data](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/), the [Open Data Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal](http://www.performance.gov/node/3396/view?view=public#overview), and the [Integrated Data Collection Open Data Progress, Use, and Impact](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-09.pdf) questions.
